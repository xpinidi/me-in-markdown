## Introduction

Hey! My name is Pinidi and this is an intro to me. I am in 10th grade of highschool. I do cross country and track. My favorite book is The Silent Patient or the first Hunger Games book since these books are full of suspense.  I recently learned how to make milk tea. One of my greatest achievements in highschool is joining a sports team. An interesting fact about me is that I am a beginner at piano and have been playing for a couple of months. My favorite food is Koththu which is a meal from my homecountry.
