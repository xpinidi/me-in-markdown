## Introduction

Hey! My name is Pinidi and this is an intro to me. I am in 10th grade of highschool. My favorite class currently is AP seminar because I enjoy learning english. I do cross country and track. Some of my hobbies include drawing, running, and watching horror movies. In my free time, I like to write stories. My favorite book is The Silent Patient or the first Hunger Games book since these books are full of suspense. I love to travel and I hope I can go to Tokyo one day.

One of my greatest achievements in highschool is joining a sports team. An interesting fact about me is that I am a beginner at piano and have been playing for a couple of months. My favorite foods are Koththu which is a dish from my homecountry, pasta, and I really like fast food like Chick-fil-A and In-n-Out.

I have lots of favorite movies that include Better Days which is a Cdrama and 10 things I Hate About You. My favorite summer experience has to be hanging out with my firends at the beach and playing volleyball. My future asipirations is to get into a good university such as UCLA or Stanford to study biology or law.
